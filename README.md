This TechAssignment was made for a Job Tech Test.

It used the following modules:

React
Redux
Redux-thunk
D3
styled components

If I would have had more time && || a colleague to ask some questions, I would have:

(with these things I was pretty close)

Displayed the name of the currencies next to the barchart.
Displayed the list of currency symbols vertically.
Removed the SearchBox after search is submitted.
Have the lettering of the conversion answer only show up after the conversion.
Borrowed someones payed account for the fixor.io api to have a more complete set of data.

(This things did not fit in the time)

Make the DataCharts perfectly visible and readible. (first time using them in React)
Focus on false entry handling and messaging accordingly.
Make the styling more efficient as reusable objects.
Make a tool to convert from any chosen currency to any chosen currency.
Show data D3 charts on how the currencies developed over the past ten years. 
Inform on what events caused the change in currency.
